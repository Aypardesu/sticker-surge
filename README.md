## Why

Before we switched to Discord my gaming group used to use a messaging program called [Telegram](https://telegram.org/). As Discord's features were fleshed out and voice chat/simple invites became a necessity for us, we decided it was time to make the switch. Although Discord has everything Telegram does and more, it's missing one crucial element: **stickers**.

To dip my toes in the water, I developed a barebones [Raspberry Pi user-bot](https://github.com/DarylPinto/discord-stickerbot) exclusively for our Discord server. As we used it I realized what features would need to be added in order for it to work well in multiple servers, and eventually it became clear a full rewrite was necessary to facilitate those changes. And so, **Stickers for Discord** was born.
