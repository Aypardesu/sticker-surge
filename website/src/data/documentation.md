## Getting Started

Inspired by other chat applications such as Telegram and LINE, Stickers for Discord aims to fill the sticker shaped void that us Discord users have in our hearts.

Getting your server set up is a piece of cake and only takes a minute:

1. [Add the bot to your server](%%INVITE_URL%%)
2. Check out the [available sticker packs](/packs) and start using the ones you like.  
   (Click on a pack, then click "Use This Pack")
3. In your server, start sending stickers by typing in their names! (Example: `:pika-rofl:`)
