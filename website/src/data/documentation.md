## Getting Started

Inspired by other chat applications such as Telegram and LINE, Stickers for Discord aims to fill the sticker shaped void that us Discord users have in our hearts.

Getting your server set up is a piece of cake and only takes a minute:

1. [Add the bot to your server](%%BOT_INVITE_URL%%)
2. Check out the [available sticker packs](/packs) and start using the ones you like.  
   (Click on a pack, then click "Use This Pack")
3. In your server, start sending stickers by typing in their names! (Example: `:pika-rofl:`)

<details>
  <summary>How do I make my own stickers?</summary>
  
  There are 3 types of stickers that you can make:

  1. *Server stickers*  
  These stickers will be usable by anyone in your Discord server. You can create them by using the `$createSticker` command. You can also create server stickers by logging in to the website, clicking on "Your Servers", selecting your server, and then clicking "Create a Sticker"

  2. *Personal Stickers*  
  These stickers will only be usable by you, but you can use them on any server where the bot is present. You can create them by direct messaging the bot with the command `$createSticker`  
  You can also create personal stickers by logging in to the website, clicking on "Personal Stickers", and clicking "Create a Sticker"
  
  3. *Sticker Packs*  
  These stickers will be publicly available for anyone to use. Don't create sticker packs if the stickers are in-jokes between you and your friends that no one else will understand (use server stickers for that). Sticker packs are for general-purpose stickers. Make them if you think many people will enjoy using them. You can create sticker packs by logging in to the website, clicking on "Sticker Packs", and then clicking "Create a Sticker Pack".
